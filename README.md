## Running of the Project
#### The project runs very smoothy with the amount of logic included in it

## Challenges
#### A major challenge during the project was the issue of scoping. Another challenge of the project was understanding how many eventlisteners are nessaary for the entire project. I eventually used 3 listeners for the 3 div blocks on the main screen

## Learning

### This project gave me a better clarities for what I learned in the past 3 weeks. I know what I need to keep studying as well as what I know what to improve on. I understand a lot more of the use of functions and understand how important DRY code is
